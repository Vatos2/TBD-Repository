The TBD word document will eventually have everything we presented 4/3 and can be updated as we go. I am not sure how that affects code uploades and downloades but I can take it down when we get to that. 

We are going to all have to agree on the same rules so for now this is what I am using:

I also have the same Players Handbook he mentions, if we want to use other rules please post a link so we can all follow along.
